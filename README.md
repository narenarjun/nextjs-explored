# NextJS explored

This app is deployed to vercel. [https://nextjs-course-app-two.vercel.app/](https://nextjs-course-app-two.vercel.app/)

## Typescript support in nextjs

NextJS supports typescript out of the box. Add tsconfig.json file and start next dev with `yarn dev` , it'll detect we are trying to use typescript immediately.

> This app doesn't use typescript. 


We can install `typescript` and `@types/react` by yarn:

```

yarn add --dev typescript @types/react

```
